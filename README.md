Employing streams, allows multiple clients to connect simultaneously, enabling seamless communication among them. Moreover, the exchanged data, specifically chat messages, are persistently logged onto a text file stored on your local machine, ensuring comprehensive chat history tracking via the server.

Implemented with a multi-threading approach and leveraging Socket programming concepts, this system facilitates efficient communication channels among multiple clients on a centralized server.
